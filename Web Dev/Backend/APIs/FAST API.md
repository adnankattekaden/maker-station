## Explaining APIs üöÄ

Before getting started with FastAPI, a refresher on the understanding of APIs is important.

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools used to build software applications. APIs enable communication between different software systems, allowing developers to easily integrate features and data from one application into another.

Think of an API as a waiter at a restaurant.

- The waiter takes your order, sends it to the kitchen, and then delivers your food to your table.
  - You don't need to know how the kitchen works or how the food is prepared; you just need to know what you want to order.
  - Similarly, with an API, you don't need to know how the underlying system works.
  - You just need to know what data you want to access or what actions you want to perform.

## Why learn FastAPI ‚ùì

- **FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

- It provides a simple and intuitive way to build APIs, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

- It is easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production, and it offers automatic interactive documentation. ü§©

- FastAPI is a good fit for building modern, scalable web applications due to its high performance and asynchronous capabilities.

## üéì Take Away Skills

After completing this learning path you will be knowledgeable in:

- Understanding of what an API is and how it works
- Ability to build a basic API with FastAPI

  ### Conceptual Knowledge:

  - Path and Query Parameters
  - Pydantic Base Model
  - Handling Forms
  - Async Databases
  - Swagger UI for API documentation
  - Test a FastAPI
  - Deploy a FastAPI application

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To get started with FastAPI, you should have some basic programming knowledge and be familiar with Python 3.7+ üêç. Additionally, it's recommended to have an understanding of [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) and [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) API principles.

## üì≤ Installation and Setup

To install FastAPI, you can use **pip**, Python's package manager. Run the following command in your terminal:

`pip install fastapi`

Unlike the Flask framework, FastAPI doesn't contain any built-in development server. Hence, you will have the need to install **Uvicorn**, a lightning-fast ASGI server, to run the FastAPI application.

`pip install uvicorn[standard]`
