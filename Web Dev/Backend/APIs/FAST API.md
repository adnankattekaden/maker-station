If you are new to APIs and want to learn how to build them using FastAPI, this learning path is for you ðŸ˜Ž

This guide will walk you through the basics of FastAPI, the benefits of using it, the skills you'll learn, the prerequisites you'll need, how to install and set up the environment, the basics of building APIs with FastAPI, and some starter projects to try out.

## Explaining APIs ðŸš€

Before getting started with FastAPI, a refresher on the understanding of APIs is important. 

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools used to build software applications. APIs enable communication between different software systems, allowing developers to easily integrate features and data from one application into another.

Think of an API as a waiter at a restaurant. 

- The waiter takes your order, sends it to the kitchen, and then delivers your food to your table. 
    - You don't need to know how the kitchen works or how the food is prepared; you just need to know what you want to order. 
    - Similarly, with an API, you don't need to know how the underlying system works. 
    - You just need to know what data you want to access or what actions you want to perform.

## Why learn FastAPI? ðŸ¤”

- **FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

- It provides a simple and intuitive way to build APIs, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

- It is easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production, and it offers automatic interactive documentation. ðŸ¤©
