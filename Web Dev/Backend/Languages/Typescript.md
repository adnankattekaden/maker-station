## Why learn TypeScript ❓

- TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It provides better tooling and error checking, making it a popular choice for large-scale projects.
- With TypeScript, you can take advantage of modern JavaScript features and type safety, leading to better code quality and maintainability.
- TypeScript is indeed widely used in combination with popular JavaScript front-end frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue. This makes it a valuable skill for web developers working on the front-end. Additionally, TypeScript is also used with popular back-end frameworks, such as Node.js, Express, NestJS further enhancing its importance in the world of full-stack web development.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Programming Knowledge

You should have a solid understanding of JavaScript, including ES6 features, before diving into TypeScript.

You can refer to the JavaScript learning path mentioned above if you need to brush up on your JavaScript skills.

## 📲 Installation and Setup

Before you install TypeScript, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager) installed on your system. npm is included with Node.js, so you only need to install Node.js:

- **Node.js**

  JavaScript runtime which helps you run JavaScript programs in your system.

  [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

  **_Note:_** Install the stable version

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can proceed with the installation of TypeScript:

- **TypeScript**

  Install TypeScript globally using npm (Node.js package manager).

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

In addition, you'll need a code editor and browser to follow along with this learning path. The preferred ones are listed below:

- **VS Code**

  Light-weight code editor by Microsoft with a large ecosystem of plugins to help your workflow

  [Install VS Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- **Google Chrome**
  A browser based on V8 JavaScript engine with developer tools.
  [Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
